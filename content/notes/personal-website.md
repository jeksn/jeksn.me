For the past few years I've been cutting down on the amount of social media I use.
First was Facebook and Instagram which I haven't used in years.
More recently I stopped using Twitter after the renaming and general mismanagement of the site. 
The same goes for Reddit, which after the blackout I finally just stopped using.
Those two have been the hardest, since they're really addicting, but I'm finally free of them.

So what this leads to is a general feeling that I want to create more and not just consume.
Not endlessly scrolling was the main thing I never want to waste time on again.
I want to read and scroll through a fixed amount of content and then move on with my life.

Keeping this site alive and building it out and making it better and better is just fun and a way I keep myself motivated to do that is to keep a contribution streak on Github.
