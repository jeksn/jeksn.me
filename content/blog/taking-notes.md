I have as many other been in a constant battle with my note taking system.
There have been many iterations and apps that I have started using and fallen off of.
I've used Notion, Joplin, Bear and several more.
This post would be way too long if I would go over all that and it wouldn't be very interesting either.
So instead of dewelling on the past let's stay in the present.

What I'm using now (and am happy with) is a combination of digital and analog tools.

### Obsidian

Obsidian is a fantastic app that so far has worked just as I want and expect a notetaking app to work.
Another big plus is that there is no locked in ecosystem around the notes.
They are just markdown files that can be moved somewhere else if sometime in the future Obisidan doesn't fit my needs or moves in a direction I don't like.

I'm using the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) to organize everything and since migrating to it I don't see myself moving away from it anytime soon.

This is also where I keep a daily journal combined with a commonplace using the Daily Note plugin.
From there I sort out anything of value into a separate note if I know it has any value and needs to be referenced later.

Otherwise the journal is mostly a way to reflect, keep sane and vent about anything happening in my life.
I try to do it every day but I don't like to be too harsh about having to do it and falling off it because of the pressure to keep up with it.

### Analog Notebooks

**Pocket notebook**
This is where I write down anything I want to remember when I'm out and not at my desk.
I of course also have my phone with me, but writing on a phone have never felt good to me.
I constantly mistype and end up frustrated everytime I have to write something down that isn't a message to someone. And even then I'd rather type it out on my laptop.


**Spiral notebook / Scratchpad**
I keep a disposable and cheap spiral notebook on my desk when I'm working and need to write something down quickly.
As with the pocket notebook anything of value will be moved into Obsidian.
There is no system here really, anything goes.
