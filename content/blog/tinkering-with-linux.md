Like a lot of people I've recently been drawn to the linux world.
Since it feels like MacOS and especielly Windows have really gotten just worse and worse from a privacy and just reular usability  perspective a pretty substantial amount of people are opening their eyes to Linux.

A lot of this probably comes from the popularity of the Steam Deck (a device that I haven't tried yet) and a pretty big community on YouTube (if you can really call it a community).
It has even had the effect of giving Linux a bit of a boost in the global marketshare of the OS market, it's still dwarfed by Windows, but hopefully this momentum keep going.

My first step into this then was getting a used Thinkpad X280 and just playing around with it.
I still need my Macbook for work, but it's very likely that I will ultimately move entirely to Linux and especially Linux Mint which is currently my distro of choice.
But the whole rabbit hole of distro-hopping will have to be a post for the future.

Just wanted to get some words down about this and will expand on it the deeper into this I get.
