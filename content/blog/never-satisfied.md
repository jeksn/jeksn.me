The eternal struggle of being happy with the setup you're using.
There is always that nagging feeling that my workflow could be better and more optimized and then I would be satisfied.
But that never happens, does it?

## Arc -> Firefox
Arc isn't available on Linux and I was starting to tire a bit of it. Firefox was just the best option and have been really happy going back to it.
## Hyper -> Warp -> Wezterm
Wezterm just works great and the config options are super nice and easy to use and share between systems.
## Spotify -> Apple Music -> Qobuz
Left Spotify years ago after it just got worse with every update.
Apple Music is the worst app I use regularly in MacOS, which is a joke.
Qobuz is far from perfect but at least I feel like I'm not lining the pockets of the worst businesses around.
