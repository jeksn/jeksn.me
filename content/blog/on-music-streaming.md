So I've now gone back to using Apple Music after my short stint away from it.
I have previously had issues with the absolutely awful experience that is Apple Music on MacOS.
So I migrated everything over to Qobuz, but unfortunately the experience of using it wasn't what had hoped it would be.
The library is not nearly as extensive as Apple Music and just that alone makes it not really justifiable to pay an even higher monthly fee.

What fixed my issue with the MacOS app was to not use it at all and instead use [Cider](https://cider.sh/), which is a separate app that provides a much better experience that the default.
It looks and works great and costs just $3.49.

So for now I'll just go with this setup for my streaming needs, but I will still keep buying CDs and music through Bandcamp.
Because I still like the idea of actually owning my favorite music.
